\begin{itemize}
	\item Definition of Fall
	\item	Change the title of the thesis
	\item	Specify the other motions of the device to be detected
\end{itemize} &
\begin{itemize} 
	\item Fall was defined on the paper as an act of falling, tripping or stumbling to specify that fall on this paper discusses not the free fall motion from a high ground to a different level of grounds.
	\item Title was changed from “Development of Wearable Device for Fall Detection Using Accelerometer with Automated Notification via GSM” to “Design and Development of Fall Analyzer”
	\item Motions are specified and set to be walking, standing, sitting and lying

Engr. John Anthony Jose & 
\begin{itemize}
 \item Include the direction of fall
 \item Detections of emergency was included on the RRL, be specific if the term “emergency” has a role in the paper.
\end{itemize}
&
\begin {itemize}
 \item Fall directions was included on the paper.
 \item Emergency features of the paper was removed as the project title focus was changed to be a developmental project.
